<b>4.</b> AnonPlus spreads ideas without censorship, creates spaces to spread directly through mass defacement, publish news that the media filtered and managed for the consumption of who controls, we do that to restore dignity to the function of the media: media should be free, without censorship and must limit itself to "show what's happening" and don't "say to us what's wrong and what's right"<br>
AnonPlus puts offline sites that actively contribute to the control of the masses from the corrupt, that by manipulating information and opinions create false realities: this is censorship!<br>
AnonPlus not act for personal or political causes, has no leaders, moves to the interests of the people and we will fight until the leadership and the powership will lead into the hand of people: unique owner of the free world<br>
<br>AnonPlus is ready to support the people's need. And people is supporting Anonplus: that's our alliance, that's our brotherhood, that's our pact.<br>
